# Introduction
This is the final project for the Computer Network course in my second year at HCMUS using **C++ 17** and **Qt 6**.
# Building
Before starting, you need to install Qt with Visual Studio Code and CMake, you can see instructions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U-lnfxY2U0)

Download .zip folder or clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/nguyenconglong2004/Remote-Desktop-Control
```
> Note: Because of a mistake, I deleted the old source code, so here are just the raw source files, so it will probably be quite cumbersome and time-consuming to rebuild the whole thing.
# Demo
